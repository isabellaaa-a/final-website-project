    Tennis is a racket sport played by two opponents (singles) or four opponents (doubles) hitting a ball over a net on a rectangular court. 
    The goal is to score points by hitting the ball in a way that the opponent cannot legally return it.
    The game involves a mix of physical and mental challenges, with scoring that proceeds as (15,30,40,) and game.
